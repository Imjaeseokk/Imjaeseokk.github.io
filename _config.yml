  Nice 2 Meet U! :)


  I love learning about new fields and acquiring knowledge I didn't know before, constantly pushing myself to improve. Whenever I identify weaknesses or shortcomings, I strive to address them, aiming to grow a little every day.

  
  I have a wide range of interests in **Computer Science**, including Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

  I'm currently an equipment engineer working in the Memory CVD Technology Team at Samsung Electronics. I'm also an undergraduate student

  at Ajou University, majoring in Integrative Systems Engineering. 


  In my undergraduate major, I'm studying System Optimization, Data Analysis/Mining, Computer Vision and fundamental Computer Science courses
  including Data Structure and Algorithms, and Databases. Additionally, I'm learning Computer Architecture and Operating Systems through Coursera.

  
  In high school, I studied Digital Logic Circuits and Microcontroller Applications using ATmega and STM chip series. This helped me understand the architecture and operation of computers.
