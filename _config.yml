  Nice 2 Meet U! :)


  I have a wide range of interests in **Computer Science**, including deep learning and reinforcement Learning.

  I'm currently an <mark>equipment engineer</mark> working in the Memory CVD Technology Team at Samsung Electronics. I'm also an undergraduate student

  at Ajou University, majoring in Integrative Systems Engineering. 


  In my role, I'm responsible for developing a monitoring platform for anomaly detection and production status tracking
  
  through production data analysis, as well as optimizing the hardware structure and conditions of CVD equipments.


  In my undergraduate major, I'm studying 

  - system optimization

  - data analysis/mining

  - computer vision 

  - fundamental computer science courses including data structure and algorithms, and databases. 
  


  Additionally, I'm learning computer architecture and operating systems through Coursera.

  
  In high school, I studied 

  - digital logic circuits 

  - microcontroller Applications using ATmega and STM chip series. 



  This helped me understand the architecture and operation of computers.

    content: >
      I have recently started learning Fencingü§∫. 
      

      Also,I've recently gotten into Texas Hold'em ‚ô†Ô∏è.


      I'm a big fan of football. I played as the captain and left forward on both my middle and high school football teams. 
      Unfortunately, due to several knee injuries, I'm no longer able to play.

      I love learning about new fields and acquiring knowledge I didn't know before, constantly pushing myself to improve. Whenever I identify weaknesses or shortcomings, I strive to address them, aiming to grow a little every day.
